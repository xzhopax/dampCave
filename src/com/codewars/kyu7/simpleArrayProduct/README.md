#Simple array product

In this Kata, you will be given 2 or more
arrays of integers, both positive and negative. 
Your task is to find the maximum product that can
be formed by taking one element from each array.

    Examples:
    solve([[1, 2],[3, 4]]) = 8, given by 2 * 4
    solve([[10,-15],[-1,-3]]) = 45, given by (-15) * (-3)
    
More examples in test cases. Good luck!
