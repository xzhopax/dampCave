Hello World

 There are many beautiful cities and towns in the world. I would like to visit some of them, to see with my own eyes what I have read or heard about. 
But there is no place like home. I love my native city. I was born here and live with my parents. It’s not the capital, but it is a wonderful place to live.

My city is old and modern at the same time. It is old because it was founded in the 11th century. At that time its streets were narrow, dark and dirty. 
Now my city looks modern because of its architecture. Almost all the buildings were built after the war. The streets and avenues are wide and clean.

I live in the main street. It is the widest street in the city. A lot of cars, buses and trolley-buses run fast along it. If you want to see the places of interest in our
 city, you can walk along the main street. It leads to the main square. It will be a short trip, but you can see a lot: a cinema and a concert hall, an art gallery and museums, 
a stadium, a zoo and a large park.

Our art gallery is next to the main post office. Opposite the post office there is a modern hotel. If you turn to the left, you can see a theatre. And in front of the theatre
 there is a museum of history and culture. Walk two blocks and you’ll come to a monument to our famous writer and a fountain in the park. If you want to visit our zoo
, take a bus and get off on the third bus stop. Not far from the traffic lights you will see the entrance to the zoo. Near it there is a circus. 
Children and tourists can’t but visit it. They admire funny clowns, tamed animals, miracles and magic.
 There are only some churches in our city. Every evening we can hear the sound of the bells.
